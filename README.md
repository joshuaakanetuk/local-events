üìÖ Local Events
=================
#### Host your local music scene's events. (No excuses about events booked on the same day).

The purpose of this app was to have an collective calendar (not unlike a shared Google Calendar) in where organizers could add events and see down the line for future events. 

Community members can see and subscribe to events in a centralized location (not unlike Facebook Events) without being on Facebook. 

Though, I don't believe it will solve the issue of organizers in the same space just keeping up with each other, this can be a centralized hub for events in small scenes and communities, as an alternative to Facebook.

Requires an admin.

## Use Cases:

üìç Add your events to a centralized location with or without Facebook.

üíÉ Community members can subscribe and watch for future events.

## TODO:
- Subscribe via email (Nodemailer integration). 
  - Daily / Weekly / Monthly emails.
- Subscribe via SMS (Twillo integration, for Patreon users). 
  - Daily / Weekly / Monthly Texts.
- Scrape events automatically from Google Calendar or Facebook Page.
- Vaildate event entries.

- Address Autocomplete (![](https://developer.here.com/documentation/geocoder-autocomplete/topics/example-location-id.html))
